## Breast Cancer Detection using ML Predictive Analytics
Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to using Machine Learning Predictive Analytics for Breast Cancer Detection.

Objective:
This repository serves as a learning exercise to:

Apply fundamental machine learning concepts to an available dataset.
Evaluate and interpret results, justifying the interpretation based on the observed dataset.
Create notebooks that serve as computational records, documenting my thought process.
The analysis is divided into five sections, each saved as a Jupyter notebook within this repository:

Identifying the Problem and Data Sources
Handling Missing Values
Feature Scaling of Data
Building a Predictive Model
Optimizing the Model
## [Notebook 1](https://github.com/Satyam0775/Breast-cancer-Detection-prediction/blob/master/master/NB1_IdentifyProblem%2BDataClean.ipynb) : Identify the types of information contained in the dataset.
In this notebook, I use Python modules to import external datasets, familiarize myself with the data, and consider various approaches to handling it.

Notebook 2: Handling Missing Values
Goal: Explore the variables to assess their relationship with the response variable.

This notebook focuses on data exploration and visualization techniques using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Understanding the data is crucial, as it provides valuable insights for preprocessing.

Notebook 3: Feature Scaling of Data
Goal: Identify and enhance the most predictive features of the data.

Here, I employ feature selection to reduce high-dimensional data, and feature extraction and transformation for dimensionality reduction, preparing the data for developing predictive models.

Notebook 4: Building a Predictive Model
Goal: Construct predictive models to detect breast cancer.

In this notebook, I construct a predictive model using the Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor. The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 97% using Random Forest for comparison.

Notebook 5: Optimizing the Model
Goal: Fine-tune the parameters of the Logistic Regression model for improved accuracy and performance.

This notebook focuses on optimizing the Logistic Regression model to achieve the best possible accuracy, refining the model's fit to the data.
